        "summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon\nfootprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is\nscarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured,\nreported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the\nmeasurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets\non Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.\nThe goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and\noptimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first\nrepository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This\nstudy seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators\nmeasure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects\nimpact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several\nkey findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon\nemissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on\nHugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the\nmain application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between\ncarbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and\nML application domains. These results highlight the need for software\nmeasurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient\nmodel development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,\ntwo classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their\ncarbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.\nThe aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and\nsustainable model development within the ML community.",

        "summary": "Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text\nretrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and\ninstead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design\nemploys a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which\nenables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and\nsimplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive\nqualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval,\nincluding the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which\nmakes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized\nURLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We\nalso propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training\ndifficulty as the corpus size increases.

        "summary": "People usually have different intents for choosing items, while their\npreferences under the same intent may also different. In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.",

However, existing RL\nrecommendation methods encounter difficulties (i) to estimate the value\nfunctions for states which are not contained in the offline training data, and\n(ii) to learn effective state representations from user implicit feedback due\nto the lack of contrastive signals.

        "summary": "Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when\ntrained on in-domain labeled datasets. However, previous studies have found\nthat dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak\nmodeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal\nbetween two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense\nretrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained\nexpression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching\nsignal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and\ntwo unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint\nin training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit\nbalance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level\nview and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a\nfine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage\nrepresentation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching\ninformation from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR\nshow that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval\ntraining methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to\nimprove its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead\nand target domain data.",

        "summary": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to\nrecommender systems as an effective collaborative filtering (CF) approach. The\nkey idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message\npassing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded\nembeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user\nbehavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits\nskewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,\nleverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the\nabove issues. Despite their effectiveness, however, they conduct\nself-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the\nexploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error\nselection of augmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nGraph Contrastive Learning (AdaptiveGCL) framework which conducts graph\ncontrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better\nempower CF paradigm. Specifically, we use two trainable view generators, which\nare a graph generative model and a graph denoising model respectively, to\ncreate contrastive views. Two generators are able to create adaptive\ncontrastive views, addressing the problem of model collapse and achieving\nadaptive contrastive learning. With two adaptive contrasive views, more\nadditionally high-quality training signals will be introduced into the CF\nparadigm and help to alleviate the data sparsity and noise issues. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmodel over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further visual\nanalysis intuitively explains why our AdaptiveGCL outperforms existing\ncontrastive learning approaches based on selected data augmentation methods.",

The re-ranker generally produces better candidate scores\nthan the retriever, but is limited to seeing only the top K retrieved\ncandidates, thus providing no improvements in retrieval performance as measured\nby Recall@K. In this work, we leverage the re-ranker to also improve retrieval\nby providing inference-time relevance feedback to the retriever. Concretely, we\nupdate the retriever's query representation for a test instance using a\nlightweight inference-time distillation of the re-ranker's prediction for that\ninstance. The distillation loss is designed to bring the retriever's candidate\nscores closer to those of the re-ranker. A second retrieval step is then\nperformed with the updated query vector.

However, there is still much to be learned about how\nwell LLMs understand structured data, such as tables. While it is true that\ntables can be used as inputs to LLMs with serialization, there lack\ncomprehensive studies examining whether LLMs can truly comprehend such data. In\nthis paper we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to evaluate\nstructural understanding capabilities (SUC) of LLMs. The benchmark we create\nincludes seven tasks, each with their own unique challenges, e.g,, cell lookup,\nrow retrieval and size detection. We run a series of evaluations on GPT-3\nfamily models (e.g., text-davinci-003). We discover that the performance varied\ndepending on a number of input choices, including table input format, content\norder, role prompting and partition marks. Drawing from the insights gained\nthrough the benchmark evaluations, we then propose self-augmentation for\neffective structural prompting, e.g., critical value / range identification\nusing LLMs' internal knowledge. When combined with carefully chosen input\nchoices, these structural prompting methods lead to promising improvements in\nLLM performance on a variety of tabular tasks, e.g., TabFact($\\uparrow2.31\\%$),\nHybridQA($\\uparrow2.13\\%$), SQA($\\uparrow2.72\\%$), Feverous($\\uparrow0.84\\%$),\nand ToTTo($\\uparrow5.68\\%$).

To address the problems, we propose a novel\nGraIL-based inductive relation reasoning model, termed MINES, by introducing a\nMessage Intercommunication mechanism on the Neighbor-Enhanced Subgraph.\nConcretely, the message intercommunication mechanism is designed to capture the\nomitted hidden mutual information.

The success of few-shot semantic\nsegmentation in 2D computer vision is mainly driven by the pre-training on\nlarge-scale datasets like imagenet. The feature extractor pre-trained on\nlarge-scale 2D datasets greatly helps the 2D few-shot learning. However, the\ndevelopment of 3D deep learning is hindered by the limited volume and instance\nmodality of datasets due to the significant cost of 3D data collection and\nannotation. This results in less representative features and large intra-class\nfeature variation for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation. As a consequence,\ndirectly extending existing popular prototypical methods of 2D few-shot\nclassification/segmentation into 3D point cloud segmentation won't work as well\nas in 2D domain. To address this issue, we propose a Query-Guided Prototype\nAdaption (QGPA) module to adapt the prototype from support point clouds feature\nspace to query point clouds feature space. With such prototype adaption, we\ngreatly alleviate the issue of large feature intra-class variation in point\ncloud and significantly improve the performance of few-shot 3D segmentation.\nBesides, to enhance the representation of prototypes, we introduce a\nSelf-Reconstruction (SR) module that enables prototype to reconstruct the\nsupport mask as well as possible.

        "summary": "Young children develop sophisticated internal models of the world based on\ntheir egocentric visual experience. How much of this is driven by innate\nconstraints and how much is driven by their experience? To investigate these\nquestions, we train state-of-the-art neural networks on a realistic proxy of a\nchild's visual experience without any explicit supervision or domain-specific\ninductive biases. Specifically, we train both embedding models and generative\nmodels on 200 hours of headcam video from a single child collected over two\nyears. We train a total of 72 different models, exploring a range of model\narchitectures and self-supervised learning algorithms, and comprehensively\nevaluate their performance in downstream tasks. The best embedding models\nperform at 70% of a highly performant ImageNet-trained model on average. They\nalso learn broad semantic categories without any labeled examples and learn to\nlocalize semantic categories in an image without any location supervision.\nHowever, these models are less object-centric and more background-sensitive\nthan comparable ImageNet-trained models. Generative models trained with the\nsame data successfully extrapolate simple properties of partially masked\nobjects, such as their texture, color, orientation, and rough outline, but\nstruggle with finer object details. We replicate our experiments with two other\nchildren and find very similar results. Broadly useful high-level visual\nrepresentations are thus robustly learnable from a representative sample of a\nchild's visual experience without strong inductive biases.",

Moreover, thanks to some dedicated adapter designs, Uni-ControlNet\nonly necessitates a constant number (i.e., 2) of adapters, regardless of the\nnumber of local or global controls used. This not only reduces the fine-tuning\ncosts and model size, making it more suitable for real-world deployment, but\nalso facilitate composability of different conditions.

        "summary": "Text-to-image model personalization aims to introduce a user-provided concept\nto the model, allowing its synthesis in diverse contexts. However, current\nmethods primarily focus on the case of learning a single concept from multiple\nimages with variations in backgrounds and poses, and struggle when adapted to a\ndifferent scenario. In this work, we introduce the task of textual scene\ndecomposition: given a single image of a scene that may contain several\nconcepts, we aim to extract a distinct text token for each concept, enabling\nfine-grained control over the generated scenes. To this end, we propose\naugmenting the input image with masks that indicate the presence of target\nconcepts. These masks can be provided by the user or generated automatically by\na pre-trained segmentation model. We then present a novel two-phase\ncustomization process that optimizes a set of dedicated textual embeddings\n(handles), as well as the model weights, striking a delicate balance between\naccurately capturing the concepts and avoiding overfitting. We employ a masked\ndiffusion loss to enable handles to generate their assigned concepts,\ncomplemented by a novel loss on cross-attention maps to prevent entanglement.\nWe also introduce union-sampling, a training strategy aimed to improve the\nability of combining multiple concepts in generated images. We use several\nautomatic metrics to quantitatively compare our method against several\nbaselines, and further affirm the results using a user study. Finally, we\nshowcase several applications of our method. Project page is available at:\nhttps://omriavrahami.com/break-a-scene/",

        "summary": "Text-to-image generation has recently witnessed remarkable achievements. We\nintroduce a text-conditional image diffusion model, termed RAPHAEL, to generate\nhighly artistic images, which accurately portray the text prompts, encompassing\nmultiple nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This is achieved by stacking tens of\nmixture-of-experts (MoEs) layers, i.e., space-MoE and time-MoE layers, enabling\nbillions of diffusion paths (routes) from the network input to the output. Each\npath intuitively functions as a \"painter\" for depicting a particular textual\nconcept onto a specified image region at a diffusion timestep. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that RAPHAEL outperforms recent cutting-edge models, such as\nStable Diffusion, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, DeepFloyd, and DALL-E 2, in terms of both\nimage quality and aesthetic appeal. Firstly, RAPHAEL exhibits superior\nperformance in switching images across diverse styles, such as Japanese comics,\nrealism, cyberpunk, and ink illustration. Secondly, a single model with three\nbillion parameters, trained on 1,000 A100 GPUs for two months, achieves a\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 6.61 on the COCO dataset. Furthermore,\nRAPHAEL significantly surpasses its counterparts in human evaluation on the\nViLG-300 benchmark. We believe that RAPHAEL holds the potential to propel the\nfrontiers of image generation research in both academia and industry, paving\nthe way for future breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.

        "summary": "This paper presents a method that can quickly adapt dynamic 3D avatars to\narbitrary text descriptions of novel styles. Among existing approaches for\navatar stylization, direct optimization methods can produce excellent results\nfor arbitrary styles but they are unpleasantly slow. Furthermore, they require\nredoing the optimization process from scratch for every new input. Fast\napproximation methods using feed-forward networks trained on a large dataset of\nstyle images can generate results for new inputs quickly, but tend not to\ngeneralize well to novel styles and fall short in quality. We therefore\ninvestigate a new approach, AlteredAvatar, that combines those two approaches\nusing the meta-learning framework. In the inner loop, the model learns to\noptimize to match a single target style well; while in the outer loop, the\nmodel learns to stylize efficiently across many styles. After training,\nAlteredAvatar learns an initialization that can quickly adapt within a small\nnumber of update steps to a novel style, which can be given using texts, a\nreference image, or a combination of both.

The core issue for learning feature matching is to how to learn (1)\ndiscriminative representations for feature points (or regions) within each\nintra-image and (2) consensus representations for feature points across\ninter-images. Recently, self- and cross-attention models have been exploited to\naddress this issue. However, in many scenes, features are coming with\nlarge-scale, redundant and outliers contaminated. Previous\nself-/cross-attention models generally conduct message passing on all primal\nfeatures which thus lead to redundant learning and high computational cost. To\nmitigate limitations, inspired by recent seed matching methods, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel efficient Anchor Matching Transformer (AMatFormer) for the\nfeature matching problem. AMatFormer has two main aspects: First, it mainly\nconducts self-/cross-attention on some anchor features and leverages these\nanchor features as message bottleneck to learn the representations for all\nprimal features. Thus, it can be implemented efficiently and compactly. Second,\nAMatFormer adopts a shared FFN module to further embed the features of two\nimages into the common domain and thus learn the consensus feature\nrepresentations for the matching problem.

As the result,\nTL;DR enables us to reduce the large dataset into a small set of high-quality\ndata, which can serve as an alternative pre-training dataset. This algorithm\nsignificantly speeds up the time-consuming pretraining process. Specifically,\nTL;DR can compress the mainstream VLP datasets at a high ratio, e.g., reduce\nwell-cleaned CC3M dataset from 2.82M to 0.67M ($\\sim$24\\%) and noisy YFCC15M\nfrom 15M to 2.5M ($\\sim$16.7\\%). Extensive experiments with three popular VLP\nmodels over seven downstream tasks show that VLP model trained on the\ncompressed dataset provided by TL;DR can perform similar or even better results\ncompared with training on the full-scale dataset.

In this paper, we first empirically\ndemonstrate that simply using high-quality pseudo labels can fairly mitigate\nthis problem in the setting of organ segmentation. Furthermore, we put forward\nan innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor\nsegmentation, which incurs minimal computational overhead. Our proposed design\ninvolves replacing the conventional output layer with a suite of lightweight,\nclass-specific heads, thereby offering the flexibility to accommodate newly\nemerging classes.

        "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is becoming popular in autonomous driving due\nto its high effectiveness and low cost. Most of the current state-of-the-art\ndetectors follow the query-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, which benefits\nfrom both BEV's strong perception power and end-to-end pipeline. Despite\nachieving substantial progress, existing works model objects via globally\nleveraging temporal and spatial information of BEV features, resulting in\nproblems when handling the challenging complex and dynamic autonomous driving\nscenarios. In this paper, we proposed an Object-Centric query-BEV detector\nOCBEV, which can carve the temporal and spatial cues of moving targets more\neffectively. OCBEV comprises three designs: Object Aligned Temporal Fusion\naligns the BEV feature based on ego-motion and estimated current locations of\nmoving objects, leading to a precise instance-level feature fusion. Object\nFocused Multi-View Sampling samples more 3D features from an adaptive local\nheight ranges of objects for each scene to enrich foreground information.\nObject Informed Query Enhancement replaces part of pre-defined decoder queries\nin common DETR-style decoders with positional features of objects on\nhigh-confidence locations, introducing more direct object positional priors.\nExtensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the challenging nuScenes\ndataset. Our approach achieves a state-of-the-art result, surpassing the\ntraditional BEVFormer by 1.5 NDS points. Moreover, we have a faster convergence\nspeed and only need half of the training iterations to get comparable\nperformance, which further demonstrates its effectiveness.",

MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model\nsize, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because\nof their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of\nsecond-order methods can only afford to update the second order information\ninfrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence\nfrom these updates.

        "summary": "A long standing goal in neuroscience has been to elucidate the functional\norganization of the brain. Within higher visual cortex, functional accounts\nhave remained relatively coarse, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and\ntaking the form of selectivity for broad categories such as faces, places,\nbodies, food, or words. Because the identification of such ROIs has typically\nrelied on manually assembled stimulus sets consisting of isolated objects in\nnon-ecological contexts, exploring functional organization without robust a\npriori hypotheses has been challenging. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce a data-driven approach in which we synthesize images predicted to\nactivate a given brain region using paired natural images and fMRI recordings,\nbypassing the need for category-specific stimuli. Our approach -- Brain\nDiffusion for Visual Exploration (\"BrainDiVE\") -- builds on recent generative\nmethods by combining large-scale diffusion models with brain-guided image\nsynthesis. Validating our method, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize\npreferred images with appropriate semantic specificity for well-characterized\ncategory-selective ROIs. We then show that BrainDiVE can characterize\ndifferences between ROIs selective for the same high-level category. Finally we\nidentify novel functional subdivisions within these ROIs, validated with\nbehavioral data. These results advance our understanding of the fine-grained\nfunctional organization of human visual cortex, and provide well-specified\nconstraints for further examination of cortical organization using\nhypothesis-driven methods.",

Secondly, this study constructs a novel hierarchical GNN\narchitecture to learn from both SVG's curve-level and chunk-level parameters.\nIn the first case study, BIGNet not only classifies phone brands but also\ncaptures brand-related features across multiple scales, such as the location of\nthe lens, the height-width ratio, and the screen-frame gap, as confirmed by AI\nevaluation.

However,\nwe still wish to ensure a balanced unlabeled distribution during inference,\nwhich is the second challenge. To address both of these challenges, we propose\na three-faceted solution: a flexible distribution alignment that progressively\naligns the classifier from a dynamically estimated unlabeled prior towards a\nbalanced distribution, a soft consistency regularization that exploits\nunderconfident pseudo-labels discarded by threshold-based methods, and a schema\nfor expanding the unlabeled set with input data from the labeled partition.\nThis last facet comes in as a response to the commonly-overlooked fact that\ndisjoint partitions of labeled and unlabeled data prevent the benefits of\nstrong data augmentation on the labeled set.

First, we\nenhance the input images with occlusions/truncation via 2D diffusion to obtain\ncleaner mask estimates and semantic features. Second, we perform\ndiffusion-guided 3D optimization to estimate shape and texture that are of\nhigh-fidelity and faithful to input images. We also propose a novel technique\nto calculate more stable image-level gradients via diffusion models compared to\nexisting alternatives. Finally, we produce realistic animations by fine-tuning\nthe rendered shape and texture under rigid part transformations. Extensive\nevaluations on multiple existing datasets as well as newly introduced noisy web\nimage collections with occlusions and truncation demonstrate that ARTIC3D\noutputs are more robust to noisy images, higher quality in terms of shape and\ntexture details, and more realistic when animated.

For such bone\nstructure analyses, deep learning technologies are promising but require\nhigh-quality labeled data for the learning, while the data labeling is costly.\nWe address this issue and propose an efficient data annotation pipeline for\nproducing a deep learning-oriented dataset. Our pipeline consists of\nnon-learning-based bone extraction (BE) and acetabulum and femoral head\nsegmentation (AFS) and active-learning-based annotation refinement (AAR).

        "summary": "Spherical CNNs generalize CNNs to functions on the sphere, by using spherical\nconvolutions as the main linear operation. The most accurate and efficient way\nto compute spherical convolutions is in the spectral domain (via the\nconvolution theorem), which is still costlier than the usual planar\nconvolutions. For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been\nlimited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In\nthis work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems.\nTo achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of\ncommon model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit\nhardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input\nrepresentations that exploit the properties of our model. Experiments show our\nlarger spherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several targets of the QM9\nmolecular benchmark, which was previously dominated by equivariant graph neural\nnetworks, and achieve competitive performance on multiple weather forecasting\ntasks.

To investigate this phenomenon, we begin\nby introducing a novel theoretical toy model for anomaly detection performance.\nThe model uncovers a fundamental trade-off between representation sufficiency\nand over-expressivity.

However, due\nto the challenges in data collection and network designs, it remains\nchallenging for existing solutions to achieve real-time full-body capture while\nbeing accurate in world space. In this work, we contribute a sequential\nproxy-to-motion learning scheme together with a proxy dataset of 2D skeleton\nsequences and 3D rotational motions in world space. Such proxy data enables us\nto build a learning-based network with accurate full-body supervision while\nalso mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physically\nplausible predictions, a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposed\nin our network so that it can be aware of foot-ground contact and motion\nmisalignment with the proxy observations.

        "summary": "Neural material representations are becoming a popular way to represent\nmaterials for rendering. They are more expressive than analytic models and\noccupy less memory than tabulated BTFs. However, existing neural materials are\nimmutable, meaning that their output for a certain query of UVs, camera, and\nlight vector is fixed once they are trained. While this is practical when there\nis no need to edit the material, it can become very limiting when the fragment\nof the material used for training is too small or not tileable, which\nfrequently happens when the material has been captured with a\ngonioreflectometer. In this paper, we propose a novel neural material\nrepresentation which jointly tackles the problems of BTF compression, tiling,\nand extrapolation. At test time, our method uses a guidance image as input to\ncondition the neural BTF to the structural features of this input image. Then,\nthe neural BTF can be queried as a regular BTF using UVs, camera, and light\nvectors. Every component in our framework is purposefully designed to maximize\nBTF encoding quality at minimal parameter count and computational complexity,\nachieving competitive compression rates compared with previous work. We\ndemonstrate the results of our method on a variety of synthetic and captured\nmaterials, showing its generality and capacity to learn to represent many\noptical properties.",

While many approaches focus on recovering high-fidelity 3D\nscenes, we focus on parsing a scene into mid-level 3D representations made of a\nsmall set of textured primitives. Such representations are interpretable, easy\nto manipulate and suited for physics-based simulations. Moreover, unlike\nexisting primitive decomposition methods that rely on 3D input data, our\napproach operates directly on images through differentiable rendering.\nSpecifically, we model primitives as textured superquadric meshes and optimize\ntheir parameters from scratch with an image rendering loss. We highlight the\nimportance of modeling transparency for each primitive, which is critical for\noptimization and also enables handling varying numbers of primitives. We show\nthat the resulting textured primitives faithfully reconstruct the input images\nand accurately model the visible 3D points, while providing amodal shape\ncompletions of unseen object regions. We compare our approach to the state of\nthe art on diverse scenes from DTU, and demonstrate its robustness on real-life\ncaptures from BlendedMVS and Nerfstudio.

We here ask\nwhether this extraordinary increase in scale also positively impacts the field\nof mechanistic interpretability. In other words, has our understanding of the\ninner workings of scaled neural networks improved as well? We here use a\npsychophysical paradigm to quantify mechanistic interpretability for a diverse\nsuite of models and find no scaling effect for interpretability - neither for\nmodel nor dataset size. Specifically, none of the nine investigated\nstate-of-the-art models are easier to interpret than the GoogLeNet model from\nalmost a decade ago. Latest-generation vision models appear even less\ninterpretable than older architectures, hinting at a regression rather than\nimprovement, with modern models sacrificing interpretability for accuracy.\nThese results highlight the need for models explicitly designed to be\nmechanistically interpretable and the need for more helpful interpretability\nmethods to increase our understanding of networks at an atomic level. We\nrelease a dataset containing more than 120'000 human responses from our\npsychophysical evaluation of 767 units across nine models.

My3DGen can\nreconstruct multi-view consistent images from an input test image, and generate\nnovel appearances by interpolating between any two images of the same\nindividual. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of\npersonalized generative priors in producing high-quality 2D portrait\nreconstructions and syntheses, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nto develop a personalized 3D generative prior. Instead of fine-tuning a large\npre-trained generative model with millions of parameters to achieve\npersonalization, we propose a parameter-efficient approach. Our method involves\nutilizing a pre-trained model with fixed weights as a generic prior, while\ntraining a separate personalized prior through low-rank decomposition of the\nweights in each convolution and fully connected layer. However,\nparameter-efficient few-shot fine-tuning on its own often leads to overfitting.\nTo address this, we introduce a regularization technique based on symmetry of\nhuman faces. This regularization enforces that novel view renderings of a\ntraining sample, rendered from symmetric poses, exhibit the same identity. By\nincorporating this symmetry prior, we enhance the quality of reconstruction and\nsynthesis, particularly for non-frontal (profile) faces. Our final system\ncombines low-rank fine-tuning with symmetry regularization and significantly\nsurpasses the performance of pre-trained models, e.g. EG3D. It introduces only\napproximately 0.6 million additional parameters per identity compared to 31\nmillion for full finetuning of the original model. As a result, our system\nachieves a 50-fold reduction in model size without sacrificing the quality of\nthe generated 3D faces.

Thanks to recent advancements, it is now possible to\ntrain a personalized generative model tailored specifically to a given\nindividual.

        "summary": "In this work, we introduce a self-supervised feature representation learning\nframework DreamTeacher that utilizes generative networks for pre-training\ndownstream image backbones. We propose to distill knowledge from a trained\ngenerative model into standard image backbones that have been well engineered\nfor specific perception tasks. We investigate two types of knowledge\ndistillation: 1) distilling learned generative features onto target image\nbackbones as an alternative to pretraining these backbones on large labeled\ndatasets such as ImageNet, and 2) distilling labels obtained from generative\nnetworks with task heads onto logits of target backbones. We perform extensive\nanalyses on multiple generative models, dense prediction benchmarks, and\nseveral pre-training regimes. We empirically find that our DreamTeacher\nsignificantly outperforms existing self-supervised representation learning\napproaches across the board. Unsupervised ImageNet pre-training with\nDreamTeacher leads to significant improvements over ImageNet classification\npre-training on downstream datasets, showcasing generative models, and\ndiffusion generative models specifically, as a promising approach to\nrepresentation learning on large, diverse datasets without requiring manual\nannotation.",

Diffusion models have risen to prominence as a\nstate-of-the-art method for image generation, denoising, inpainting,\nsuper-resolution, manipulation, etc. Such models involve training a U-Net to\niteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesize\nhigh fidelity, diverse, novel images. The U-Net architecture, as a\nconvolution-based architecture, generates a diverse set of feature\nrepresentations in the form of intermediate feature maps. We present our\nfindings that these embeddings are useful beyond the noise prediction task, as\nthey contain discriminative information and can also be leveraged for\nclassification. We explore optimal methods for extracting and using these\nembeddings for classification tasks, demonstrating promising results on the\nImageNet classification task.

        "summary": "Automated surgical step recognition is an important task that can\nsignificantly improve patient safety and decision-making during surgeries.\nExisting state-of-the-art methods for surgical step recognition either rely on\nseparate, multi-stage modeling of spatial and temporal information or operate\non short-range temporal resolution when learned jointly. However, the benefits\nof joint modeling of spatio-temporal features and long-range information are\nnot taken in account. In this paper, we propose a vision transformer-based\napproach to jointly learn spatio-temporal features directly from sequence of\nframe-level patches. Our method incorporates a gated-temporal attention\nmechanism that intelligently combines short-term and long-term spatio-temporal\nfeature representations. We extensively evaluate our approach on two cataract\nsurgery video datasets, namely Cataract-101 and D99, and demonstrate superior\nperformance compared to various state-of-the-art methods. These results\nvalidate the suitability of our proposed approach for automated surgical step\nrecognition. Our code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/nisargshah1999/GLSFormer",

Existing feature\nlifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use\nestimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space,\nwhich is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and\nlift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while\nsuffering from a depth ambiguity problem. In contrast, our DFA3D-based method\nfirst leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D\nand then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature\nmaps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively\nalleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined\nlayer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture.

There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics and\nhuman-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as early\nas possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning,\nenabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network uses\nevents to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference.\nThe model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence over\ntime and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, the\nattention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of the\nspatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that the\nTransformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-based\napproaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actions\nlie in very subtle cues.

        "summary": "Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing\na few demonstrations of the tool's usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are\nhard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong\ndemonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are\nreadily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how\nmany and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection\nsearch grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work\nprovides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the\nuse of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over\ndemonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings\non 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing\nbenchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for\neliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot\nprompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds\nof available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more\nvaluable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly\noutperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits\nof tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using\njust-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight\nthe possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new\napplications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino,\nStable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the\njust-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.",

Recently,\nzero-shot OCR has piqued the interest of the research community because it\nconsiders a practical OCR scenario with unbalanced data distribution. However,\nthere is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating such zero-shot methods that apply\na divide-and-conquer recognition strategy by decomposing characters into\nradicals. Meanwhile, radical recognition, as another important OCR task, also\nlacks radical-level annotation for model training. In this paper, we construct\nan ancient Chinese character image dataset that contains both radical-level and\ncharacter-level annotations to satisfy the requirements of the above-mentioned\nmethods, namely, ACCID, where radical-level annotations include radical\ncategories, radical locations, and structural relations. To increase the\nadaptability of ACCID, we propose a splicing-based synthetic character\nalgorithm to augment the training samples and apply an image denoising method\nto improve the image quality. By introducing character decomposition and\nrecombination, we propose a baseline method for zero-shot OCR.

However, how to fully leverage CLIP's\nunprecedented human-like understanding capabilities to achieve better zero-shot\nclassification is still an open question. This paper draws inspiration from the\nhuman visual perception process: a modern neuroscience view suggests that in\nclassifying an object, humans first infer its class-independent attributes\n(e.g., background and orientation) which help separate the foreground object\nfrom the background, and then make decisions based on this information.\nInspired by this, we observe that providing CLIP with contextual attributes\nimproves zero-shot classification and mitigates reliance on spurious features.\nWe also observe that CLIP itself can reasonably infer the attributes from an\nimage. With these observations, we propose a training-free, two-step zero-shot\nclassification method named PerceptionCLIP. Given an image, it first infers\ncontextual attributes (e.g., background) and then performs object\nclassification conditioning on them.

To prevent deformation folding and\nenhance the smoothness of deformation, we not only impose a positivity\nconstraint in optimizing the relaxation function, but also employ a regularizer\nto ensure the smoothness of the relaxation function.Furthermore, the positivity\nconstraint ensures that is as close to one as possible, which helps to obtain a\nvolume-preserving transformation on average.We further analyze the existence of\nthe minimizer for the variational model and propose a penalty splitting method\nwith a multilevel strategy to solve this model.

To\nthis end, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{virtual voxels}, which takes over\nthe clustering-based instance segmentation in FSDv1. Virtual voxels not only\naddress the notorious issue of the Center Feature Missing problem in fully\nsparse detectors but also endow the framework with a more elegant and\nstreamlined approach. Consequently, we develop a suite of components to\ncomplement the virtual voxel concept, including a virtual voxel encoder, a\nvirtual voxel mixer, and a virtual voxel assignment strategy. Through empirical\nvalidation, we demonstrate that the virtual voxel mechanism is functionally\nsimilar to the handcrafted clustering in FSDv1 while being more general.

However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain\nmakes it challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques for this\ntask. To tackle this issue, current research employs pretrained models and\nfinetunes them on the given data. Even so, these require training deep networks\nwith millions of parameters every time new data becomes available. A recently\npublished foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large\nvariety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable\nextent. However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is\nwithout utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using\ntask-specific prompts. Moreover, these prompts are in the form of\nbounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated\nexplicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with\nhigher data size. In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive\nmodification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently,\nwhile enabling text-prompted segmentation. For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we\npropose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller\nnumber of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\\%).

In a large-scale empirical study across\ncombinations of four different open-source chest x-ray datasets and 9 different\nlabels, we demonstrate that in 43% of settings, a model trained on data from\ntwo hospitals has poorer worst group accuracy over both hospitals than a model\ntrained on just a single hospital's data.

We highlight the trade-off one encounters\nwhen training on multiple datasets, between the obvious benefit of additional\ndata and insidious cost of the introduced spurious correlation. In some cases,\nbalancing the dataset can remove the spurious correlation and improve\nperformance, but it is not always an effective strategy.

We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial\nvehicle) and report its ability to seamlessly follow the objects of interest in\na real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight\n(6-8 GB) graphics card, achieving a throughput of 6-20 frames per second. To\nenable rapid adoption, deployment, and extensibility, we open-source all our\ncode on our project webpage at https://github.com/alaamaalouf/FollowAnything .\nWe also encourage the reader the watch our 5-minutes explainer video in this\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mgt3EPytrw .",

Humans are able to learn new concepts using only few examples, by\ndistilling the important information from memories and discarding the rest.\nSimilarly, continual learning methods learn new classes whilst retaining the\nknowledge of known classes, whilst few-shot learning methods are able to learn\nnew classes using very few training examples. We propose a novel continual\nlearning method inspired by human cognition and learning that can accurately\nrecognise new compound expression classes using few training samples, by\nbuilding on and retaining its knowledge of basic expression classes.

In contrast, such privilege has not\nyet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of\nlarge-scale 3D datasets.

However, due\nto the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision\ncould adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated\nperformance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In\nview of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel\nframework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D\nrepresentation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on\nthis framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model\nto different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided\nCategorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces\nby leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify\nthat PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic\nlearning and produce generalizable representations.

Specifically, HumanLiff firstly generates\nminimal-clothed humans, represented by tri-plane features, in a canonical\nspace, and then progressively generates clothes in a layer-wise manner. In this\nway, the 3D human generation is thus formulated as a sequence of\ndiffusion-based 3D conditional generation.

Thus, prior works\nhave proposed jointly optimizing camera parameters alongside a NeRF, but these\nmethods are prone to local minima in challenging settings. In this work, we\nanalyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization\nproblem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences\nin magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an\nill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to\ncompute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera\nparameters and normalizes their effects, and we propose to use this transform\nas a preconditioner for the camera parameters during joint optimization.

Much of the critical\ninformation in patent documents and scientific articles is contained in\nfigures, depicting the molecule structures.

In this work, we introduce MolGrapher to recognize chemical\nstructures visually. First, a deep keypoint detector detects the atoms. Second,\nwe treat all candidate atoms and bonds as nodes and put them in a graph. This\nconstruct allows a natural graph representation of the molecule. Last, we\nclassify atom and bond nodes in the graph with a Graph Neural Network. To\naddress the lack of real training data, we propose a synthetic data generation\npipeline producing diverse and realistic results.

        "summary": "Image segmentation plays an essential role in nuclei image analysis.\nRecently, the segment anything model has made a significant breakthrough in\nsuch tasks. However, the current model exists two major issues for cell\nsegmentation: (1) the image encoder of the segment anything model involves a\nlarge number of parameters. Retraining or even fine-tuning the model still\nrequires expensive computational resources. (2) in point prompt mode, points\nare sampled from the center of the ground truth and more than one set of points\nis expected to achieve reliable performance, which is not efficient for\npractical applications. In this paper, a single-point prompt network is\nproposed for nuclei image segmentation, called SPPNet. We replace the original\nimage encoder with a lightweight vision transformer. Also, an effective\nconvolutional block is added in parallel to extract the low-level semantic\ninformation from the image and compensate for the performance degradation due\nto the small image encoder. We propose a new point-sampling method based on the\nGaussian kernel. The proposed model is evaluated on the MoNuSeg-2018 dataset.\nThe result demonstrated that SPPNet outperforms existing U-shape architectures\nand shows faster convergence in training. Compared to the segment anything\nmodel, SPPNet shows roughly 20 times faster inference, with 1/70 parameters and\ncomputational cost.

        "summary": "Existing methods of multiple human parsing (MHP) apply statistical models to\nacquire underlying associations between images and labeled body parts. However,\nacquired associations often contain many spurious correlations that degrade\nmodel generalization, leading statistical models to be vulnerable to visually\ncontextual variations in images (e.g., unseen image styles/external\ninterventions). To tackle this, we present a causality inspired parsing\nparadigm termed CIParsing, which follows fundamental causal principles\ninvolving two causal properties for human parsing (i.e., the causal diversity\nand the causal invariance). Specifically, we assume that an input image is\nconstructed by a mix of causal factors (the characteristics of body parts) and\nnon-causal factors (external contexts), where only the former ones cause the\ngeneration process of human parsing.Since causal/non-causal factors are\nunobservable, a human parser in proposed CIParsing is required to construct\nlatent representations of causal factors and learns to enforce representations\nto satisfy the causal properties. In this way, the human parser is able to rely\non causal factors w.r.t relevant evidence rather than non-causal factors w.r.t\nspurious correlations, thus alleviating model degradation and yielding improved\nparsing ability. Notably, the CIParsing is designed in a plug-and-play fashion\nand can be integrated into any existing MHP models. Extensive experiments\nconducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of our method.",

NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\\deg} scenes\nfrom a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in\ncapturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a\nhybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any\nworld point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than\neach.

        "summary": "The regression of 3D Human Pose and Shape (HPS) from an image is becoming\nincreasingly accurate. This makes the results useful for downstream tasks like\nhuman action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, and\naccuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearance\nthat are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do not\nreport the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannot\ndifferentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, we\ndevelop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate not\nonly a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass.\nSpecifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance.\nThe key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressing\nuncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCO\nframework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it by\nmodifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reason\nabout uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. While\nthis was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our main\nmotivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; we\ndemonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrap\nHPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of a\nPOCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with this\nautomatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty in\nvideo pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. due\nto occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames.

However, whole-slide imaging (WSI) poses a complex computer vision\nproblem in which the large-scale image resolutions of WSIs and the enormous\ndiversity of morphological phenotypes preclude large-scale data annotation.\nCurrent efforts have proposed using pretrained image encoders with either\ntransfer learning from natural image datasets or self-supervised pretraining on\npublicly-available histopathology datasets, but have not been extensively\ndeveloped and evaluated across diverse tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI,\na general-purpose self-supervised model for pathology, pretrained using over\n100 million tissue patches from over 100,000 diagnostic haematoxylin and\neosin-stained WSIs across 20 major tissue types, and evaluated on 33\nrepresentative CPath clinical tasks in CPath of varying diagnostic\ndifficulties.

To alleviate this problem, we equip\nthe generator in generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a plug-and-play\nmodule, termed as modulated transformation module (MTM). This module predicts\nspatial offsets under the control of latent codes, based on which the\nconvolution operation can be applied at variable locations for different\ninstances, and hence offers the model an additional degree of freedom to handle\ngeometry deformation. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can be\nfaithfully generalized to various generative tasks, including image generation,\n3D-aware image synthesis, and video generation, and get compatible with\nstate-of-the-art frameworks without any hyper-parameter tuning.

Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,\ndetecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable\nin high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked\nModality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables\nsegmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method\nis based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality\ntranslation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.\nImage-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are\ncharacteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to\ntranslate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during\ntraining, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine\nimage translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to\n`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown\npatterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method\non a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021\nmulti-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors.

        "summary": "Recent years have witnessed great progress in creating vivid audio-driven\nportraits from monocular videos. However, how to seamlessly adapt the created\nvideo avatars to other scenarios with different backgrounds and lighting\nconditions remains unsolved. On the other hand, existing relighting studies\nmostly rely on dynamically lighted or multi-view data, which are too expensive\nfor creating video portraits. To bridge this gap, we propose ReliTalk, a novel\nframework for relightable audio-driven talking portrait generation from\nmonocular videos. Our key insight is to decompose the portrait's reflectance\nfrom implicitly learned audio-driven facial normals and images. Specifically,\nwe involve 3D facial priors derived from audio features to predict delicate\nnormal maps through implicit functions. These initially predicted normals then\ntake a crucial part in reflectance decomposition by dynamically estimating the\nlighting condition of the given video. Moreover, the stereoscopic face\nrepresentation is refined using the identity-consistent loss under simulated\nmultiple lighting conditions, addressing the ill-posed problem caused by\nlimited views available from a single monocular video. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the superiority of our proposed framework on both real and synthetic\ndatasets. Our code is released in https://github.com/arthur-qiu/ReliTalk.",

Existing efforts propose metrics that allow a user to choose one\nmodel from a pool of pre-trained models without having to fine-tune each model\nindividually and identify one explicitly. With the growth in the number of\navailable pre-trained models and the popularity of model ensembles, it also\nbecomes essential to study the transferability of multiple-source models for a\ngiven target task. The few existing efforts study transferability in such\nmulti-source ensemble settings using just the outputs of the classification\nlayer and neglect possible domain or task mismatch. Moreover, they overlook the\nmost important factor while selecting the source models, viz., the cohesiveness\nfactor between them, which can impact the performance and confidence in the\nprediction of the ensemble. To address these gaps, we propose a novel Optimal\ntranSport-based suBmOdular tRaNsferability metric (OSBORN) to estimate the\ntransferability of an ensemble of models to a downstream task. OSBORN\ncollectively accounts for image domain difference, task difference, and\ncohesiveness of models in the ensemble to provide reliable estimates of\ntransferability. We gauge the performance of OSBORN on both image\nclassification and semantic segmentation tasks.

Our key insight is\nthat the accuracy of the 6D object pose estimate can be improved by explicitly\ncompleting the shape of the object. To this end, we introduce a novel\nvisuotactile shape completion module that uses a conditional Generative\nAdversarial Network to complete the shape of an in-hand object based on\nvolumetric representation. This approach improves over prior works that\ndirectly regress visuotactile observations to a 6D pose. By explicitly\ncompleting the shape of the in-hand object and jointly optimizing the shape\ncompletion and pose estimation tasks, we improve the accuracy of the 6D object\npose estimate. We train and test our model on a synthetic dataset and compare\nit with the state-of-the-art. In the visuotactile shape completion task, we\noutperform the state-of-the-art by 265% using the Intersection of Union metric\nand achieve 88% lower Chamfer Distance. In the visuotactile pose estimation\ntask, we present results that suggest our framework reduces position and\nangular errors by 35% and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, we ablate our\nframework to confirm the gain on the 6D object pose estimate from explicitly\ncompleting the shape. Ultimately, we show that our framework produces models\nthat are robust to sim-to-real transfer on a real-world robot platform.",

Towards this end, both explicit and implicit 3D representations\nare heavily studied for a holistic modeling and capture of the whole human\n(e.g., body, clothing, face and hair), but neither representation is an optimal\nchoice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human\navatar have different modeling desiderata. For example, meshes are generally\nnot suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present\nDisentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit\n3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a\nhuman avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we\nconsider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,\nwe disentangle the face and hair. To do so, DELTA represents the body or face\nwith an explicit mesh-based parametric 3D model and the clothing or hair with\nan implicit neural radiance field. To make this possible, we design an\nend-to-end differentiable renderer that integrates meshes into volumetric\nrendering, enabling DELTA to learn directly from monocular videos without any\n3D supervision. Finally, we show that how these two applications can be easily\ncombined to model full-body avatars, such that the hair, face, body and\nclothing can be fully disentangled yet jointly rendered. Such a disentanglement\nenables hair and clothing transfer to arbitrary body shapes. We empirically\nvalidate the effectiveness of DELTA's disentanglement by demonstrating its\npromising performance on disentangled reconstruction, virtual clothing try-on\nand hairstyle transfer.

Self-supervised learning techniques, such as\ncontrastive and non-contrastive approaches, have been shown to learn rich and\neffective representations of digitized tissue samples with limited pathologist\nsupervision. Our analysis of vanilla SSL-pretrained models' attention\ndistribution reveals an insightful observation: sparsity in attention, i.e,\nmodels tends to localize most of their attention to some prominent patterns in\nthe image. Although attention sparsity can be beneficial in natural images due\nto these prominent patterns being the object of interest itself, this can be\nsub-optimal in digital pathology; this is because, unlike natural images,\ndigital pathology scans are not object-centric, but rather a complex phenotype\nof various spatially intermixed biological components. Inadequate\ndiversification of attention in these complex images could result in crucial\ninformation loss. To address this, we leverage cell segmentation to densely\nextract multiple histopathology-specific representations, and then propose a\nprior-guided dense pretext task for SSL, designed to match the multiple\ncorresponding representations between the views. Through this, the model learns\nto attend to various components more closely and evenly, thus inducing adequate\ndiversification in attention for capturing context rich representations.\nThrough quantitative and qualitative analysis on multiple tasks across cancer\ntypes, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method and observe that the attention\nis more globally distributed.",

We\nargue that existing methods are limited because they employ a monolithic\nmodeling approach, using a single representation for the head, face, hair, and\naccessories. Our observation is that the hair and face, for example, have very\ndifferent structural qualities that benefit from different representations.\nBuilding on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in\nwhich the head, face, and upper body are represented with traditional 3D\nmeshes, and the hair, clothing, and accessories with neural radiance fields\n(NeRF). The model-based mesh representation provides a strong geometric prior\nfor the face region, improving realism while enabling editing of the person's\nappearance.

In this work, we propose Robust\ne-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving\nevent cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and\nnoisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key\ncomponents: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various\nintrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and\nrefractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold\nvariation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses\nthat can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic\nparameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel\nrealistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic\ndataset and improved event simulator are public.",

While camera rotation estimation is a\nwell-studied problem, no previous methods exhibit both high accuracy and\nacceptable speed in this setting. Because the setting is not addressed well by\nother datasets, we provide a new dataset and benchmark, with high-accuracy,\nrigorously verified ground truth, on 17 video sequences. Methods developed for\nwide baseline stereo (e.g., 5-point methods) perform poorly on monocular video.\nOn the other hand, methods used in autonomous driving (e.g., SLAM) leverage\nspecific sensor setups, specific motion models, or local optimization\nstrategies (lagging batch processing) and do not generalize well to handheld\nvideo. Finally, for dynamic scenes, commonly used robustification techniques\nlike RANSAC require large numbers of iterations, and become prohibitively slow.\nWe introduce a novel generalization of the Hough transform on SO(3) to\nefficiently and robustly find the camera rotation most compatible with optical\nflow. Among comparably fast methods, ours reduces error by almost 50\\% over the\nnext best, and is more accurate than any method, irrespective of speed.

However, these models\ntend to have strong single-image understanding capability but lack the ability\nto understand multiple images. Therefore, they cannot be directly applied to\ncope with image change understanding (ICU), which requires models to capture\nactual changes between multiple images and describe them in language. In this\npaper, we discover that existing VLFMs perform poorly when applied directly to\nICU because of the following problems: (1) VLFMs generally learn the global\nrepresentation of a single image, while ICU requires capturing nuances between\nmultiple images. (2) The ICU performance of VLFMs is significantly affected by\nviewpoint variations, which is caused by the altered relationships between\nobjects when viewpoint changes. To address these problems, we propose a\nViewpoint Integration and Registration method. Concretely, we introduce a fused\nadapter image encoder that fine-tunes pre-trained encoders by inserting\ndesigned trainable adapters and fused adapters, to effectively capture nuances\nbetween image pairs.

While aiming for comparable performance, distillation with weight\ninheritance can speed up the training by 1.4 - 7.8 $\\times$ compared to\ntraining from scratch.

Given a single RGBD\nimage combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector\npose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force\ngoal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has\ndemonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals\ncan enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to\nmanipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in\nthese systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an\neye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,\ndrawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen\nenvironments with object instances that differed significantly from the\ntraining data.

The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations\namong the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision.

What would it take to enable such\ncapabilities in robotic reinforcement learning (RL)? Offline RL methods, which\nlearn from datasets of robot experience, offer one way to leverage prior data\ninto the robotic learning pipeline. However, these methods have a \"type\nmismatch\" with video data (such as Ego4D), the largest prior datasets available\nfor robotics, since video offers observation-only experience without the action\nor reward annotations needed for RL methods. In this paper, we develop a system\nfor leveraging large-scale human video datasets in robotic offline RL, based\nentirely on learning value functions via temporal-difference learning. We show\nthat value learning on video datasets learns representations that are more\nconducive to downstream robotic offline RL than other approaches for learning\nfrom video data.

        "summary": "Hand-crafted image quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, are commonly used\nto evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these\nmetrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one\ngenerally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall\ndissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions,\nwhich, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this\npaper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics\nto human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5\ndatasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4\nexisting attack methods to reconstruct images from many different\nclassification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human\nannotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal\nthat the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human\nevaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often\ncontradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in\nthe community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based\nmeasure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original\nand reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using\nan original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as\na positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on\nhuman annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on\nthe semantic level.

Modelling dense non-rigid object\ndeformations in this setting remained largely unaddressed so far, although such\neffects can improve the realism of the downstream applications such as AR/VR\nand avatar communications. This is due to the severe ill-posedness of the\nmonocular view setting and the associated challenges. While it is possible to\nnaively track multiple non-rigid objects independently using 3D templates or\nparametric 3D models, such an approach would suffer from multiple artefacts in\nthe resulting 3D estimates such as depth ambiguity, unnatural intra-object\ncollisions and missing or implausible deformations. Hence, this paper\nintroduces the first method that addresses the fundamental challenges depicted\nabove and that allows tracking human hands interacting with human faces in 3D\nfrom single monocular RGB videos. We model hands as articulated objects\ninducing non-rigid face deformations during an active interaction. Our method\nrelies on a new hand-face motion and interaction capture dataset with realistic\nface deformations acquired with a markerless multi-view camera system. As a\npivotal step in its creation, we process the reconstructed raw 3D shapes with\nposition-based dynamics and an approach for non-uniform stiffness estimation of\nthe head tissues, which results in plausible annotations of the surface\ndeformations, hand-face contact regions and head-hand positions.

While recent approaches that leverage\npre-trained generative models can synthesize high-quality novel views from\nin-the-wild inputs, they still struggle to maintain 3D consistency across\ndifferent views. In this paper, we present Consistent-1-to-3, which is a\ngenerative framework that significantly mitigate this issue. Specifically, we\ndecompose the NVS task into two stages: (i) transforming observed regions to a\nnovel view, and (ii) hallucinating unseen regions. We design a scene\nrepresentation transformer and view-conditioned diffusion model for performing\nthese two stages respectively. Inside the models, to enforce 3D consistency, we\npropose to employ epipolor-guided attention to incorporate geometry\nconstraints, and multi-view attention to better aggregate multi-view\ninformation. Finally, we design a hierarchy generation paradigm to generate\nlong sequences of consistent views, allowing a full 360 observation of the\nprovided object image. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation over multiple\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms against\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

Nevertheless, synthesizing\nnovel views from a single image still remains a significant challenge in the\nrealm of computer vision. Previous approaches tackle this problem by adopting\nmesh prediction, multi-plain image construction, or more advanced techniques\nsuch as neural radiance fields. Recently, a pre-trained diffusion model that is\nspecifically designed for 2D image synthesis has demonstrated its capability in\nproducing photorealistic novel views, if sufficiently optimized on a 3D\nfinetuning task. Although the fidelity and generalizability are greatly\nimproved, training such a powerful diffusion model requires a vast volume of\ntraining data and model parameters, resulting in a notoriously long time and\nhigh computational costs. To tackle this issue, we propose Efficient-3DiM, a\nsimple but effective framework to learn a single-image novel-view synthesizer.\nMotivated by our in-depth analysis of the inference process of diffusion\nmodels, we propose several pragmatic strategies to reduce the training overhead\nto a manageable scale, including a crafted timestep sampling strategy, a\nsuperior 3D feature extractor, and an enhanced training scheme. When combined,\nour framework is able to reduce the total training time from 10 days to less\nthan 1 day, significantly accelerating the training process under the same\ncomputational platform (one instance with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs).

Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream\nreward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high\nvariance of the gradient estimators.

This work introduces MatFormer, a nested\nTransformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of\ndeployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer\nmodel is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training\nprocedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers --\ni.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of\naccurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically\ndemonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders\n&amp; encoders), modalities (language &amp; vision), and scales (up to 2.6B\nparameters).

To this\nend, we propose a novel method, called DELIFFAS, which parameterizes the\nappearance of the human as a surface light field that is attached to a\ncontrollable and deforming human mesh model. At the core, we represent the\nlight field around the human with a deformable two-surface parameterization,\nwhich enables fast and accurate inference of the human appearance. This allows\nperceptual supervision on the full image compared to previous approaches that\ncould only supervise individual pixels or small patches due to their slow\nruntime. Our carefully designed human representation and supervision strategy\nleads to state-of-the-art synthesis results and inference time.

Moreover, we develop a\ndifferentiable depth peeling algorithm to effectively learn the proposed model\nfrom RGB videos. Experiments show that our representation can be rendered at\nover 400 FPS on the DNA-Rendering dataset at 1080p resolution and 80 FPS on the\nENeRF-Outdoor dataset at 4K resolution using an RTX 4090 GPU, which is 30x\nfaster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art rendering\nquality.

While current learning-based depth estimation models train\nand test on meticulously curated data, they often overlook out-of-distribution\n(OoD) situations.

Addressing this\noversight, we introduce a comprehensive robustness test suite, RoboDepth,\nencompassing 18 corruptions spanning three categories: i) weather and lighting\nconditions; ii) sensor failures and movement; and iii) data processing\nanomalies. We subsequently benchmark 42 depth estimation models across indoor\nand outdoor scenes to assess their resilience to these corruptions. Our\nfindings underscore that, in the absence of a dedicated robustness evaluation\nframework, many leading depth estimation models may be susceptible to typical\ncorruptions. We delve into design considerations for crafting more robust depth\nestimation models, touching upon pre-training, augmentation, modality, model\ncapacity, and learning paradigms.

However, existing video generation models are typically trained on a\nlimited number of frames, resulting in the inability to generate high-fidelity\nlong videos during inference. Furthermore, these models only support\nsingle-text conditions, whereas real-life scenarios often require multi-text\nconditions as the video content changes over time. To tackle these challenges,\nthis study explores the potential of extending the text-driven capability to\ngenerate longer videos conditioned on multiple texts. 1) We first analyze the\nimpact of initial noise in video diffusion models. Then building upon the\nobservation of noise, we propose FreeNoise, a tuning-free and time-efficient\nparadigm to enhance the generative capabilities of pretrained video diffusion\nmodels while preserving content consistency. Specifically, instead of\ninitializing noises for all frames, we reschedule a sequence of noises for\nlong-range correlation and perform temporal attention over them by window-based\nfunction. 2) Additionally, we design a novel motion injection method to support\nthe generation of videos conditioned on multiple text prompts. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the\ngenerative capabilities of video diffusion models.

For this, meshes are\nappealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic\nmaterial and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are\nmemory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing\nand statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being\ntopologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D\nrepresentation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,\nopen, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for\nreconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material\nand lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation\nthat open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we\nparameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on\nwatertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a\ngrid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight\nand non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called\nGhost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:\ndifferentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and\ngenerative modelling of non-watertight meshes.

Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical value\nbecause of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution. Consider for example\ninpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. Since there is a high\nprobability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set of\nsamples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practically\nidentical) completions of sky.

We present 6-DoFusion, a generative model capable of generating 3D\nposes of an object that produces a stable configuration of a given scene.\nUnderlying 6-DoFusion is a diffusion model that incrementally refines a\nrandomly initialized SE(3) pose to generate a sample from a learned,\ncontext-dependent distribution over stable poses. We evaluate our model on\ndifferent object placement and stacking tasks, demonstrating its ability to\nconstruct stable scenes that involve novel object classes as well as to improve\nthe accuracy of state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation methods.",

However, through a decade-long history of the robustness evaluation\nliterature, we have learned that mounting a strong or optimal attack is\nchallenging. It requires both machine learning and domain expertise. In other\nwords, the white-box threat model, religiously assumed by a large majority of\nthe past literature, is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a new practical\nthreat model where the adversary relies on transfer attacks through publicly\navailable surrogate models. We argue that this setting will become the most\nprevalent for security-sensitive applications in the future. We evaluate the\ntransfer attacks in this setting and propose a specialized defense method based\non a game-theoretic perspective. The defenses are evaluated under 24 public\nmodels and 11 attack algorithms across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet). Under this threat model, our defense, PubDef, outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art white-box adversarial training by a large margin with almost\nno loss in the normal accuracy. For instance, on ImageNet, our defense achieves\n62% accuracy under the strongest transfer attack vs only 36% of the best\nadversarially trained model. Its accuracy when not under attack is only 2%\nlower than that of an undefended model (78% vs 80%). We release our code at\nhttps://github.com/wagner-group/pubdef.",

The proposed DDAM module encourages domain mixing to minimize\nthe distance between the two extreme domains, thereby enhancing the ReID task.\nTo achieve this, we introduce two bridge losses and a disparity loss. The\nobjective of the two bridge losses is to guide the moderate mixed-domain\nrepresentations to maintain an appropriate distance from both the source and\ntarget domain representations. The disparity loss aims to prevent the moderate\nmixed-domain representations from being biased towards either the source or\ntarget domains, thereby avoiding overfitting.

However, in\npractice, they produce artifacts and distortions and struggle to control the\namount of rain generated due to a lack of proper constraints. In this paper, we\npropose an unpaired image-to-image translation framework for generating\nrealistic rainy images. We first introduce a Triangular Probability Similarity\n(TPS) constraint to guide the generated images toward clear and rainy images in\nthe discriminator manifold, thereby minimizing artifacts and distortions during\nrain generation. Unlike conventional contrastive learning approaches, which\nindiscriminately push negative samples away from the anchors, we propose a\nSemantic Noise Contrastive Estimation (SeNCE) strategy and reassess the pushing\nforce of negative samples based on the semantic similarity between the clear\nand the rainy images and the feature similarity between the anchor and the\nnegative samples. Experiments demonstrate realistic rain generation with\nminimal artifacts and distortions, which benefits image deraining and object\ndetection in rain. Furthermore, the method can be used to generate realistic\nsnowy and night images, underscoring its potential for broader applicability.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/TPSeNCE.",

An idempotent operator is one that can be applied\nsequentially without changing the result beyond the initial application, namely\n$f(f(z))=f(z)$. The proposed model $f$ is trained to map a source distribution\n(e.g, Gaussian noise) to a target distribution (e.g. realistic images) using\nthe following objectives: (1) Instances from the target distribution should map\nto themselves, namely $f(x)=x$. We define the target manifold as the set of all\ninstances that $f$ maps to themselves. (2) Instances that form the source\ndistribution should map onto the defined target manifold. This is achieved by\noptimizing the idempotence term, $f(f(z))=f(z)$ which encourages the range of\n$f(z)$ to be on the target manifold. Under ideal assumptions such a process\nprovably converges to the target distribution. This strategy results in a model\ncapable of generating an output in one step, maintaining a consistent latent\nspace, while also allowing sequential applications for refinement.\nAdditionally, we find that by processing inputs from both target and source\ndistributions, the model adeptly projects corrupted or modified data back to\nthe target manifold.

Conventional deepfake detection methods train\nsupervised classifiers to distinguish real media from previously encountered\ndeepfakes. Such techniques can only detect deepfakes similar to those\npreviously seen, but not zero-day (previously unseen) attack types. As current\ndeepfake generation techniques are changing at a breathtaking pace, new attack\ntypes are proposed frequently, making this a major issue. Our main observations\nare that: i) in many effective deepfake attacks, the fake media must be\naccompanied by false facts i.e. claims about the identity, speech, motion, or\nappearance of the person. For instance, when impersonating Obama, the attacker\nexplicitly or implicitly claims that the fake media show Obama; ii) current\ngenerative techniques cannot perfectly synthesize the false facts claimed by\nthe attacker. We therefore introduce the concept of \"fact checking\", adapted\nfrom fake news detection, for detecting zero-day deepfake attacks. Fact\nchecking verifies that the claimed facts (e.g. identity is Obama), agree with\nthe observed media (e.g. is the face really Obama's?), and thus can\ndifferentiate between real and fake media. Consequently, we introduce FACTOR, a\npractical recipe for deepfake fact checking and demonstrate its power in\ncritical attack settings: face swapping and audio-visual synthesis. Although it\nis training-free, relies exclusively on off-the-shelf features, is very easy to\nimplement, and does not see any deepfakes, it achieves better than\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.",

Specifically, we first devise a set of\nnovel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the\nvisual detection system and the language system. A communication token is\ngenerated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the\ndetection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence\ngenerated so far.

To remedy this deficiency, we propose Video Instance\nMatting~(VIM), that is, estimating alpha mattes of each instance at each frame\nof a video sequence. To tackle this challenging problem, we present MSG-VIM, a\nMask Sequence Guided Video Instance Matting neural network, as a novel baseline\nmodel for VIM. MSG-VIM leverages a mixture of mask augmentations to make\npredictions robust to inaccurate and inconsistent mask guidance. It\nincorporates temporal mask and temporal feature guidance to improve the\ntemporal consistency of alpha matte predictions. Furthermore, we build a new\nbenchmark for VIM, called VIM50, which comprises 50 video clips with multiple\nhuman instances as foreground objects. To evaluate performances on the VIM\ntask, we introduce a suitable metric called Video Instance-aware Matting\nQuality~(VIMQ).

        "summary": "Hashing is at the heart of large-scale image similarity search, and recent\nmethods have been substantially improved through deep learning techniques. Such\nalgorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a\nsubsequent costly binarization step, a common solution is to employ loss\nfunctions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are\ngrouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that\nthe embedding entries are close to binarized entries, e.g., -1 or 1). Still,\nthe interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the\nembeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that\ndecomposes the learning problem in two stages: first, perform similarity\nlearning over the embedding space with no quantization; second, find an optimal\northogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding\nis close to its sign, and then quantize the transformed embedding through the\nsign function. In the second step, we parametrize orthogonal transformations\nusing Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent.\nSince similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal\ntransformations, this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of\nperformance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised, fast, hyperparameter-free\nand can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning\nalgorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach\nleads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets, and,\nunlike other quantization strategies, brings consistent improvements in\nperformance to existing deep hashing algorithms.",

First, given a vision-language task, we adopt\nLLMs to examine whether we could reuse and grow over established modules to\nhandle this new task. If not, we initialize a new module needed by the task and\nspecify the inputs and outputs of this new module. After that, the new module\nis created by querying LLMs to generate corresponding code snippets that match\nthe requirements.

While\nseveral existing works have achieved impressive results for this task, they\nmainly rely on a time-consuming optimization paradigm. Specifically, these\nmethods optimize a neural field from scratch for each text prompt, taking\napproximately one hour or more to generate one object. This heavy and\nrepetitive training cost impedes their practical deployment. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation, dubbed Instant3D.\nOnce trained, Instant3D is able to create a 3D object for an unseen text prompt\nin less than one second with a single run of a feedforward network. We achieve\nthis remarkable speed by devising a new network that directly constructs a 3D\ntriplane from a text prompt. The core innovation of our Instant3D lies in our\nexploration of strategies to effectively inject text conditions into the\nnetwork. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective activation function,\nthe scaled-sigmoid, to replace the original sigmoid function, which speeds up\nthe training convergence by more than ten times. Finally, to address the Janus\n(multi-head) problem in 3D generation, we propose an adaptive Perp-Neg\nalgorithm that can dynamically adjust its concept negation scales according to\nthe severity of the Janus problem during training, effectively reducing the\nmulti-head effect.

LfO can\nfacilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and\nreducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a\ntransformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and\naction pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation\nor inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While\nseveral existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity\nrecognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However,\nSA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single\nviewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the\nobserved task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing\nocclusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and\nsynchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present\nmulti-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception\nof multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better\nrecognize the state and action in each frame.

Second, while the visual\ninstruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue\nformat, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns\nare weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To\ntackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types:\ncritique and refinement.

        "summary": "Multimodal learning, which integrates data from diverse sensory modes, plays\na pivotal role in artificial intelligence. However, existing multimodal\nlearning methods often struggle with challenges where some modalities appear\nmore dominant than others during multimodal learning, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose MLA (Multimodal Learning\nwith Alternating Unimodal Adaptation). MLA reframes the conventional joint\nmultimodal learning process by transforming it into an alternating unimodal\nlearning process, thereby minimizing interference between modalities.\nSimultaneously, it captures cross-modal interactions through a shared head,\nwhich undergoes continuous optimization across different modalities. This\noptimization process is controlled by a gradient modification mechanism to\nprevent the shared head from losing previously acquired information. During the\ninference phase, MLA utilizes a test-time uncertainty-based model fusion\nmechanism to integrate multimodal information. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on five diverse datasets, encompassing scenarios with complete\nmodalities and scenarios with missing modalities. These experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of MLA over competing prior approaches.",

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework,\ncalled Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose\nestimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant\nframes and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose\ntokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model\nefficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster\n(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic\ndiversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we\ndevelop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed\nspatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the\nnetwork output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast\ninference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and\nMPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and\nestimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models.

PoseGPT\naddresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token\nwithin a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both\ntextual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction\nbut also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human\nposes, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning\nabout pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate\n3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish\nbenchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and\nestimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing\nmultimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks.\nFurthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based\non complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis.",

However, existing\nworks rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in\narchitecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present\nOneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified\nframework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a\nprogressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image\nprojection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a\nuniversal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules\nand dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM\nwith the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following\ninstructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset,\nincluding 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU\nand fMRI brain activity. OneLLM is evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks,\nencompassing tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering and\nreasoning, where it delivers excellent performance.

In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by\nstate of the art text-to-image models, for the training of supervised models:\nimage classifiers with label supervision, and CLIP with language supervision.\nWe identify several factors, including text prompts, classifier-free guidance\nscale, and types of text-to-image models, that significantly affect scaling\nbehavior. After tuning these factors, we observe that synthetic images\ndemonstrate a scaling trend similar to, but slightly less effective than, real\nimages in CLIP training, while they significantly underperform in scaling when\ntraining supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main\nreason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image models to generate certain concepts, a limitation that\nsignificantly impairs the training of image classifiers.

In this paper, we delve deep into the noise\ninitialization of video diffusion models, and discover an implicit\ntraining-inference gap that attributes to the unsatisfactory inference quality.\nOur key findings are: 1) the spatial-temporal frequency distribution of the\ninitial latent at inference is intrinsically different from that for training,\nand 2) the denoising process is significantly influenced by the low-frequency\ncomponents of the initial noise. Motivated by these observations, we propose a\nconcise yet effective inference sampling strategy, FreeInit, which\nsignificantly improves temporal consistency of videos generated by diffusion\nmodels. Through iteratively refining the spatial-temporal low-frequency\ncomponents of the initial latent during inference, FreeInit is able to\ncompensate the initialization gap between training and inference, thus\neffectively improving the subject appearance and temporal consistency of\ngeneration results.

This paper addresses this research problem and introduces\nnf2vec, a framework capable of generating a compact latent representation for\nan input NF in a single inference pass. We demonstrate that nf2vec effectively\nembeds 3D objects represented by the input NFs and showcase how the resulting\nembeddings can be employed in deep learning pipelines to successfully address\nvarious tasks, all while processing exclusively NFs. We test this framework on\nseveral NFs used to represent 3D surfaces, such as unsigned/signed distance and\noccupancy fields. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nwith more complex NFs that encompass both geometry and appearance of 3D objects\nsuch as neural radiance fields.",

        "summary": "Low-light images often suffer from limited visibility and multiple types of\ndegradation, rendering low-light image enhancement (LIE) a non-trivial task.\nSome endeavors have been recently made to enhance low-light images using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, they have low efficiency in\nlearning the structural information and diverse illumination levels at the\nlocal regions of an image. Consequently, the enhanced results are affected by\nunexpected artifacts, such as unbalanced exposure, blur, and color bias. To\nthis end, this paper proposes a novel framework, called ClassLIE, that combines\nthe potential of CNNs and transformers. It classifies and adaptively learns the\nstructural and illumination information from the low-light images in a holistic\nand regional manner, thus showing better enhancement performance. Our framework\nfirst employs a structure and illumination classification (SIC) module to learn\nthe degradation information adaptively. In SIC, we decompose an input image\ninto an illumination map and a reflectance map. A class prediction block is\nthen designed to classify the degradation information by calculating the\nstructure similarity scores on the reflectance map and mean square error on the\nillumination map. As such, each input image can be divided into patches with\nthree enhancement difficulty levels. Then, a feature learning and fusion (FLF)\nmodule is proposed to adaptively learn the feature information with CNNs for\ndifferent enhancement difficulty levels while learning the long-range\ndependencies for the patches in a holistic manner. Experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets consistently show our ClassLIE achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, with 25.74 PSNR and 0.92 SSIM on the LOL dataset.",

Most\nexisting methods rely on RGB inputs, which have severe limitations under\nlow-light conditions and suffer from motion blur.

Public datasets generally have\nlimited diversity in terms of human poses and camera viewpoints, largely due to\nthe resource-intensive nature of collecting 3D human pose data. As a result,\npose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when\napplied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed\naugmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large\namount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or\nresult in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen,\nwhich learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback\nloss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our\ngenerated data is optimized to improve the robustness of the pre-trained model.\nThe objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the\nprediction error of a given pre-trained model. As the learned data distribution\ncontains OOD samples of the pre-trained model, sampling data from such a\ndistribution for further fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves the\ngeneralizability of the model. This is the first work that proposes NeRFs for\n3D human data generation. NeRFs are data-driven and do not require 3D scans of\nhumans. Therefore, using NeRF for data generation is a new direction for\nconvenient user-specific data generation.

In previous work, the amodal segmentation ground truth on\nreal images is usually predicted by manual annotaton and thus is subjective. In\ncontrast, we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine\nauthentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real\nimages. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation\nbenchmark, MP3D-Amodal, consisting of a variety of object categories and\nlabels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild, we explore two\narchitecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder,\nfollowed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the\nrepresentation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many\ncategories. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on Amodal segmentation datasets that cover a large\nvariety of objects, including COCOA and our new MP3D-Amodal dataset.

Specifically, the dynamic\nurban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic\nlogits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or\nthe background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each\nobject point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a\ndynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit\nrepresentation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which\nin turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS\n(1066$\\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training.

        "summary": "Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm\nin vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting\nthese models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization\nremains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by\nlearning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these works\nrequire labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize\ntowards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternative\napproach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from\nlarge language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, these\nmethods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to\nother classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each\nclass separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these\nboth streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from\nLLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of\nimages, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich\ncontextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped\nwithin the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new\nclasses and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized\nprompts using text only data. We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks\nwhere our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive\nto those utilizing labeled images.

Based on a user-provided textual description\nand a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in\n3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly\ntransformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion\nmodels in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in\nediting 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing\nobjects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods,\nwhich we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D\nobject insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The\n2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method.\nThe reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors\nof monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D\nscenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our\nexperiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate\nthe effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods.

Numerous previous works train their models\nusing the well-established connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.\nDuring the inference stage, the CTC-based models typically take the entire sign\nvideo as input to make predictions. This type of inference scheme is referred\nto as offline recognition. In contrast, while mature speech recognition systems\ncan efficiently recognize spoken words on the fly, sign language recognition\nstill falls short due to the lack of practical online solutions. In this work,\nwe take the first step towards filling this gap. Our approach comprises three\nphases: 1) developing a sign language dictionary encompassing all glosses\npresent in a target sign language dataset; 2) training an isolated sign\nlanguage recognition model on augmented signs using both conventional\nclassification loss and our novel saliency loss; 3) employing a sliding window\napproach on the input sign sequence and feeding each sign clip to the\nwell-optimized model for online recognition. Furthermore, our online\nrecognition model can be extended to boost the performance of any offline\nmodel, and to support online translation by appending a gloss-to-text network\nonto the recognition model. By integrating our online framework with the\npreviously best-performing offline model, TwoStream-SLR, we achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T,\nand CSL-Daily.

To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal\nrelightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses,\nilluminations, and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using\nimages captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically\nrendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process\nwhile retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior\nbased on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light\nstage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the\ncross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp\ndetails without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To\nthis end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural\nrenderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing\nnon-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model\nexplicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage\ntraining from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under\narbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities.

To do this\nwe embrace group ambiguity through physical scale: by optimizing a\nscale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, a point in the world can belong to\ndifferent groups of different sizes. We optimize this field from a set of 2D\nmasks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine\nhierarchy, using scale to consistently fuse conflicting masks from different\nviewpoints. From this field we can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via\nautomatic tree construction or user interaction.

Recent advances in the development of vision-language\nfoundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated\nCXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making\nand improve patient outcomes.

Despite its importance, the field has been\nlagging in terms of learning, especially in 3D, as annotating affordance\naccompanies a laborious process due to the numerous variations of human-object\ninteraction. The low availability of affordance data limits the learning in\nterms of generalization for object categories, and also simplifies the\nrepresentation of affordance, capturing only a fraction of the affordance. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a novel, self-supervised method to\ngenerate the 3D affordance examples given only a 3D object, without any manual\nannotations. The method starts by capturing the 3D object into images and\ncreating 2D affordance images by inserting humans into the image via inpainting\ndiffusion models, where we present the Adaptive Mask algorithm to enable human\ninsertion without altering the original details of the object. The method\nconsequently lifts inserted humans back to 3D to create 3D human-object pairs,\nwhere the depth ambiguity is resolved within a depth optimization framework\nthat utilizes pre-generated human postures from multiple viewpoints. We also\nprovide a novel affordance representation defined on relative orientations and\nproximity between dense human and object points, that can be easily aggregated\nfrom any 3D HOI datasets. The proposed representation serves as a primitive\nthat can be manifested to conventional affordance representations via simple\ntransformations, ranging from physically exerted affordances to nonphysical\nones.

Existing reconstruction approaches often treat clothed humans as\na single-layer of geometry and overlook the inherent compositionality of humans\nwith hairstyles, clothing, and accessories, thereby limiting the utility of the\nmeshes for downstream applications. Decomposing a single-layer mesh into\nseparate layers is a challenging task because it requires the synthesis of\nplausible geometry and texture for the severely occluded regions. Moreover,\neven with successful decomposition, meshes are not normalized in terms of poses\nand body shapes, failing coherent composition with novel identities and poses.\nTo address these challenges, we propose to leverage the general knowledge of a\npretrained 2D diffusion model as geometry and appearance prior for humans and\nother assets. We first separate the input mesh using the 3D surface\nsegmentation extracted from multi-view 2D segmentations. Then we synthesize the\nmissing geometry of different layers in both posed and canonical spaces using a\nnovel pose-guided Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. Once we complete\ninpainting high-fidelity 3D geometry, we also apply the same SDS loss to its\ntexture to obtain the complete appearance including the initially occluded\nregions. Through a series of decomposition steps, we obtain multiple layers of\n3D assets in a shared canonical space normalized in terms of poses and human\nshapes, hence supporting effortless composition to novel identities and\nreanimation with novel poses.

We propose a novel scale distillation approach to train our\nSR model. Instead of directly training our SR model on the scale factor of\ninterest, we start by training a teacher model on a smaller magnification\nscale, thereby making the SR problem simpler for the teacher. We then train a\nstudent model for a higher magnification scale, using the predictions of the\nteacher as a target during the training. This process is repeated iteratively\nuntil we reach the target scale factor of the final model. The rationale behind\nour scale distillation is that the teacher aids the student diffusion model\ntraining by i) providing a target adapted to the current noise level rather\nthan using the same target coming from ground truth data for all noise levels\nand ii) providing an accurate target as the teacher has a simpler task to\nsolve. We empirically show that the distilled model significantly outperforms\nthe model trained for high scales directly, specifically with few steps during\ninference. Having a strong diffusion model that requires only one step allows\nus to freeze the U-Net and fine-tune the decoder on top of it.

        "summary": "Feature shaping refers to a family of methods that exhibit state-of-the-art\nperformance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. These approaches\nmanipulate the feature representation, typically from the penultimate layer of\na pre-trained deep learning model, so as to better differentiate between\nin-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. However, existing feature-shaping methods\nusually employ rules manually designed for specific model architectures and OOD\ndatasets, which consequently limit their generalization ability. To address\nthis gap, we first formulate an abstract optimization framework for studying\nfeature-shaping methods. We then propose a concrete reduction of the framework\nwith a simple piecewise constant shaping function and show that existing\nfeature-shaping methods approximate the optimal solution to the concrete\noptimization problem. Further, assuming that OOD data is inaccessible, we\npropose a formulation that yields a closed-form solution for the piecewise\nconstant shaping function, utilizing solely the ID data. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that the feature-shaping function optimized by our method\nimproves the generalization ability of OOD detection across a large variety of\ndatasets and model architectures.",

In addition to the implicit neural radiance\nfield (NeRF) modeling, our key insight is to exploit two sources of\nregularization that explicitly propagate the editing information across\ndifferent views, thus ensuring multi-view consistency. For geometric\nregularization, we leverage the depth information derived from NeRF to\nestablish image correspondences between different views. For learned\nregularization, we align the latent codes in the 2D diffusion model between\nedited and unedited images, enabling us to edit key views and propagate the\nupdate throughout the entire scene. Incorporating these two strategies, our\nViCA-NeRF operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we blend edits from\ndifferent views to create a preliminary 3D edit. This is followed by a second\nstage of NeRF training, dedicated to further refining the scene's appearance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that ViCA-NeRF provides more flexible,\nefficient (3 times faster) editing with higher levels of consistency and\ndetails, compared with the state of the art.

While SDF methods are trained to\nestablish correspondences between two images, their performances are almost\nexclusively evaluated using relative pose estimation metrics. Thus, the link\nbetween their ability to establish correspondences and the quality of the\nresulting estimated pose has thus far received little attention. This paper is\na first attempt to study this link. We start with proposing a novel structured\nattention-based image matching architecture (SAM). It allows us to show a\ncounter-intuitive result on two datasets (MegaDepth and HPatches): on the one\nhand SAM either outperforms or is on par with SDF methods in terms of\npose/homography estimation metrics, but on the other hand SDF approaches are\nsignificantly better than SAM in terms of matching accuracy. We then propose to\nlimit the computation of the matching accuracy to textured regions, and show\nthat in this case SAM often surpasses SDF methods. Our findings highlight a\nstrong correlation between the ability to establish accurate correspondences in\ntextured regions and the accuracy of the resulting estimated pose/homography.\nOur code will be made available.",

        "summary": "While surface-based view synthesis algorithms are appealing due to their low\ncomputational requirements, they often struggle to reproduce thin structures.\nIn contrast, more expensive methods that model the scene's geometry as a\nvolumetric density field (e.g. NeRF) excel at reconstructing fine geometric\ndetail. However, density fields often represent geometry in a \"fuzzy\" manner,\nwhich hinders exact localization of the surface. In this work, we modify\ndensity fields to encourage them to converge towards surfaces, without\ncompromising their ability to reconstruct thin structures. First, we employ a\ndiscrete opacity grid representation instead of a continuous density field,\nwhich allows opacity values to discontinuously transition from zero to one at\nthe surface. Second, we anti-alias by casting multiple rays per pixel, which\nallows occlusion boundaries and subpixel structures to be modelled without\nusing semi-transparent voxels. Third, we minimize the binary entropy of the\nopacity values, which facilitates the extraction of surface geometry by\nencouraging opacity values to binarize towards the end of training. Lastly, we\ndevelop a fusion-based meshing strategy followed by mesh simplification and\nappearance model fitting. The compact meshes produced by our model can be\nrendered in real-time on mobile devices and achieve significantly higher view\nsynthesis quality compared to existing mesh-based approaches.",

In the context of this reality,\nexisting diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face\nchallenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain.\nTo overcome this limitation, we present the Flexible Vision Transformer (FiT),\na transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with\nunrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios.

This perspective enables a flexible\ntraining strategy that effortlessly adapts to diverse aspect ratios during both\ntraining and inference phases, thus promoting resolution generalization and\neliminating biases induced by image cropping. Enhanced by a meticulously\nadjusted network structure and the integration of training-free extrapolation\ntechniques, FiT exhibits remarkable flexibility in resolution extrapolation\ngeneration.

For this, we introduce the Blended\nPositional Encodings, a technique that leverages both absolute and relative\npositional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically, global motion\ncoherence is recovered at the absolute stage, whereas smooth and realistic\ntransitions are built at the relative stage. As a result, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, realism, and smoothness on the\nBabel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single\ndescription per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention,\nwhich makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time.\nFinally, to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics, we propose two new\nmetrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk, to detect abrupt\ntransitions.",

        "summary": "Steering the behavior of a strong model pre-trained on internet-scale data\ncan be difficult due to the scarcity of competent supervisors. Recent studies\nreveal that, despite supervisory noises, a strong student model may surpass its\nweak teacher when fine-tuned on specific objectives. Yet, the effectiveness of\nsuch weak-to-strong generalization remains limited, especially in the presence\nof large capability gaps. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge\nby harnessing a diverse set of specialized teachers, instead of a single\ngeneralist one, that collectively supervises the strong student. Our approach\nresembles the classical hierarchical mixture of experts, with two components\ntailored for co-supervision: (i) we progressively alternate student training\nand teacher assignment, leveraging the growth of the strong student to identify\nplausible supervisions; (ii) we conservatively enforce teacher-student and\nlocal-global consistency, leveraging their dependencies to reject potential\nannotation noises. We validate the proposed method through visual recognition\ntasks on the OpenAI weak-to-strong benchmark and additional multi-domain\ndatasets.

This paper tackles two\ninterconnected issues within this realm of personalizing text-to-image\ndiffusion models. First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably\nextend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch\nbetween complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset\n(e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized\nconcepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just\nthe degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all\nconcepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the\noverall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a\nsemi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine\npersonalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions.\nUsing this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to benchmark\nthe task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a\ncomprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better\nquantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized text-to-image\ndiffusion methods.

Prior work has proposed building scene graphs of the\nenvironment but typically assumes that the environment is static, omitting\nregions that require active interactions. This severely limits their ability to\nhandle more complex tasks in household and office environments: before setting\nup a table, robots must explore drawers and cabinets to locate all utensils and\ncondiments. In this work, we introduce the novel task of interactive scene\nexploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an\naction-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the\nunderlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information, such\nas geometry and semantics, and high-level information, such as the\naction-conditioned relationships between different entities in the scene. To\nthis end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which\nincorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to\nenhance our system's capabilities.

We\nintegrate the proposed branch into VGG16 and ResNet34, respectively, and\nconduct experiments on multiple datasets.

Our method splits the model input into multiple patches and assigns each\npatch to a GPU. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely implementing such an algorithm breaks the\ninteraction between patches and loses fidelity, while incorporating such an\ninteraction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this\ndilemma, we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent\ndiffusion steps and propose displaced patch parallelism, which takes advantage\nof the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed\nfeature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current\nstep. Therefore, our method supports asynchronous communication, which can be\npipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be\napplied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve\nup to a 6.1$\\times$ speedup on eight NVIDIA A100s compared to one.

        "summary": "The quality of the data and annotation upper-bounds the quality of a\ndownstream model. While there exist large text corpora and image-text pairs,\nhigh-quality video-text data is much harder to collect. First of all, manual\nlabeling is more time-consuming, as it requires an annotator to watch an entire\nvideo. Second, videos have a temporal dimension, consisting of several scenes\nstacked together, and showing multiple actions. Accordingly, to establish a\nvideo dataset with high-quality captions, we propose an automatic approach\nleveraging multimodal inputs, such as textual video description, subtitles, and\nindividual video frames. Specifically, we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos\nfrom the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset. We then split them into\nsemantically consistent video clips, and apply multiple cross-modality teacher\nmodels to obtain captions for each video. Next, we finetune a retrieval model\non a small subset where the best caption of each video is manually selected and\nthen employ the model in the whole dataset to select the best caption as the\nannotation. In this way, we get 70M videos paired with high-quality text\ncaptions. We dub the dataset as Panda-70M. We show the value of the proposed\ndataset on three downstream tasks: video captioning, video and text retrieval,\nand text-driven video generation. The models trained on the proposed data score\nsubstantially better on the majority of metrics across all the tasks.",

Today's methods are data-driven, where the actuations\nfor finite elements are inferred from captured skin geometry. Unfortunately,\nthese approaches have not been widely adopted due to the complexity of\ninitializing the material space and learning the deformation model for each\ncharacter separately, which often requires a skilled artist followed by lengthy\nnetwork training. In this work, we aim to make physics-based facial animation\nmore accessible by proposing a generalized physical face model that we learn\nfrom a large 3D face dataset in a simulation-free manner. Once trained, our\nmodel can be quickly fit to any unseen identity and produce a ready-to-animate\nphysical face model automatically. Fitting is as easy as providing a single 3D\nface scan, or even a single face image. After fitting, we offer intuitive\nanimation controls, as well as the ability to retarget animations across\ncharacters.

In this\npaper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique\ninto AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the\nretriever augments the generator.

Current autoencoding-based segmentation approaches\nencounter limitations as they are constrained by the encoder and undergo a\nreduction in resolution during the encoding stage. The inability to recover\nlost information in the decoding phase further impedes these approaches.\nConsequently, their capacity to extract the retinal microvascular structure is\nrestricted. To address this issue, we introduce Swin-Res-Net, a specialized\nmodule designed to enhance the precision of retinal vessel segmentation.\nSwin-Res-Net utilizes the Swin transformer which uses shifted windows with\ndisplacement for partitioning, to reduce network complexity and accelerate\nmodel convergence. Additionally, the model incorporates interactive fusion with\na functional module in the Res2Net architecture. The Res2Net leverages\nmulti-scale techniques to enlarge the receptive field of the convolutional\nkernel, enabling the extraction of additional semantic information from the\nimage. This combination creates a new module that enhances the localization and\nseparation of micro vessels in the retina. To improve the efficiency of\nprocessing vascular information, we've added a module to eliminate redundant\ninformation between the encoding and decoding steps.\n  Our proposed architecture produces outstanding results, either meeting or\nsurpassing those of other published models.

It predicts certain classes more often than other classes, making\ninaccurate over-confident predictions. This paper mitigates this issue to\nimprove performance in the CTA scenario. To alleviate the bias issue, we make\nclass-wise exponential moving average target prototypes with reliable target\nsamples and exploit them to cluster the target features class-wisely.
